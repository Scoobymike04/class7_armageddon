# **README: Lab 1b \- Incident Response & Operational Hardening**

## **📌 Overview**

This repository contains the documentation and deliverables for Lab 1b, focusing on transitioning a monolithic database configuration into a tiered, secure architecture and executing a professional incident response drill.  
Scenario: "Anyone can deploy. Professionals recover."  
This lab simulates an on-call rotation where the production database has become unavailable. My objective was to observe, diagnose, and recover the system without redeploying infrastructure or guessing the root cause.

## **📂 Documentation Structure**

The documentation is organized into four distinct sections:

### **1: Architectural Evolution (1a → 1b)**

Outlines the initial hardening steps taken to prepare the environment.

* Key Actions: Establishing the SNS Alerting pipeline, implementing the "Split-Storage Strategy" (SSM Parameter Store vs. Secrets Manager), and refactoring application code for dual-source retrieval.

### **2: Mandatory Incident Runbook (Deliverable)**

The core operational document. It follows a strict, evidence-based remediation process for a Network Isolation failure.

* Process: Acknowledge → Observe (Logs) → Validate (SSM/SM) → Contain → Recover → Post-Incident Validation.

### **3: Incident Response Report (Deliverable)**

A high-level executive summary of the recovery efforts.

* Metrics: Calculated Time to Recovery (TTR) by correlating UTC CloudWatch logs with local EST timestamps.  
* Analysis: Root cause identification and timeline.

### **4: Operations & Incident Reflections (Deliverable)**

A critical look at the operational maturity of the system.

* Preventive Actions: Strategy for reducing MTTR and preventing recurrence through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and automated drift detection.

## **🛠 Key Skills Demonstrated**

* Observability: Configuring CloudWatch Alarms and Custom Metrics.  
* Log Analysis: Querying AWS CloudWatch Logs via CLI to identify specific error signatures (Error 2003 vs. 1045).  
* Security & IAM: Implementing "Least Privilege" for EC2 Instance Profiles and managing sensitive data via Secrets Manager.  
* Incident Management: Following an industry-standard Runbook to resolve production issues under pressure.

## **🚀 How to Navigate**

* Detailed screenshots of the AWS Console and CLI outputs are embedded within each section.  
* Parts 2, 3, and 4 are parts of the deliverables and are within the 'Deliverables' directory.  
* The refactored application logic can be found in the provided `user_data_prop.sh` file.
